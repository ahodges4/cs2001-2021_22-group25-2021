## Project Idea
To inform people in food poverty about the help available to them.
To provide a platform for charities to get into contact with people who need help.
To make it easier for people to donate to food charities
### UN Sustainable development goal number: 2

### Motivation:
Too few people in poverty using food banks, We believe one of the reasons for this is lack of easily available and accessible information.
We think with our skillset making a web application would be the ideal way to help those in need with this motivation in mind.
### Features:
Map of foodbanks and charities
,info on the process of contacting charities for help
,info on the process of using a foodbank
,Donation links
,news posted by registered food banks on the news page.
